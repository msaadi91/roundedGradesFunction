# roundedGradesFunction
This function will take an array for students's grades
then will return a rounded grades array based on the below conditions:
1- If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
2- If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
